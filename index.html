        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>My name is Nathalie Mairena and I am a rising senior at the University of Miami. An English and Journalism major, I find myself writing a lot and hope to get published one day. My interests in writing seem to fluctuate between literary fiction short stories and large fantasy novels.</p>
        <p>I've been wanting to write since I was a little girl and through my experience at the University of Miami, the dream has become more and more tangible. This site works not only as a guide to anyone I work with in the future but also as a way for me to keep to track of what got me to where I am in the present and to where I want to go in the future.</p>
        <p>On this site you'll find a collection of my working experiences throughout my years in college and my plans for the future projects involving writing and the arts. I also have a recommended reading list for anyone interested in what inspires me to keep writing.</p>

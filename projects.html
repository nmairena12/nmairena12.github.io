        <h2 id="thesistitle">Thesis Project</h2>
        <section id="thesis">
            <p>Starting Fall 2019, I will begin working on my thesis project. Working with Dr. Gautier, an English professer at the University of Miami, I will be completing my first collection of short stories and preparing them for publication following my graduation.</p>
            <p>The short story collection will include stories I have worked on in class and more I will work on during my Senior year, focusing especially on literary fiction. Speaking to Dr.Guatier, the theme seems to be 'strange men doing strange things'. I'll leave that up to intepretation.</p>

        <h2 id="noveltitle">Novel</h2>
        <section id="novel">
            <p>This is a novel project I have spent years working on and imagining. During the Spring 2019 semester, I chose to work on it for an independent project and am planning to continue it forward during the summer.</p>
            <p>An almagamation of my love for character driven stories and high fantasy, the project is tentatively named Knight and Sword. A fill in title, I hope to expand it, with the first two chapters written in their first draft and the majority of the story outlined. As I continue to solidify the plot, I will update with more information.</p>

        <section id="art">
            <p>Along with working on writing, I hope to expand my art skills through study of anatomy and more focus on practicing. I believe that along with writing, it's important to get into more tactile art</p>
            <p>One of my main art projects include doll repainting, a community I have found that has flared my creativity and my desire to have a tangible piece of art. This summer, I hope to complete my first set of dolls and possibly begin selling them. I plan to document my art progress on my Instagram where the OOAK ("one of a kind") doll community is thriving.</p>

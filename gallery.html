      <h2 id="titleone">Fantasy Literature</h2>

        <img id="frankpic" src="imgs/frank.jpg" alt="Frankenstein Norton Critical Edition, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="frank">
          <h3>Frankenstein: A Norton Critical Edition</h3>
          <h4>Mary Shelley</h4>
          <p>I highly recommend this edition in particular because of the large amounts of notes and essays included. It's especially interesting to see the changes between editions and a great way to read the thought behind the novel.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="grendelpic" src="imgs/grendel.jpg" alt="Grendel, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="grendel">
          <h3>Grendel</h3>
          <h4>John Gardner</h4>
          <p>It might not be everyone's cup of tea but Grendel does a great job of analyzing the classic monster of Beuwulf.</p>
          <p>It's full of interesting imagery, metaphors and a good look at what makes someone a monster and man. All of this mixed with Gardner's interesting prose makes it really unique.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="beowulfpic" src="imgs/beowulf.jpg" alt="Beowulf, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="beowulf">
          <h3>Beowulf</h3>
          <h4>Translation by Seamus Heaney</h4>
          <p>Of course, if you read Grendel you have to read Beowulf. It's a little dense but it's one of the oldest pieces of English literature, making it significant for that fact only.</p>
          <p>This translation in particular really brings the epic poem to life and makes it a lot easier to read for a modern reader.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="windpic" src="imgs/wind.jpg" alt="Name of the Wind, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="wind">
          <h3>Name of the Wind</h3>
          <h4>Patrick Rothfuss</h4>
          <p>The prose is beautiful, the world is rich and Rothfuss trusts his readers to be smart enough to connect the pieces.</p>
          <p>The characters are memorable and the story is epic and full of a great system of magic. It's also being turned into a movie and show soon, which'll serve to bring this masterpiece to life!</p>
        </section>

      <h2 id="titletwo">Childhood Inspiration</h2>

        <img id="childpic" src="imgs/child.jpg" alt="The Moorchild, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="child">
          <h3>The Moorchild</h3>
          <h4>Eloise McGraw</h4>
          <p>I read this book to tatters over the years and ended up having to buy a new copy. It's what first introduced me to the lore of the fae outside of Disney and is not afraid to bring up serious topics to its child audience.</p>
          <p>It's a bittersweet story that has you rooting for the young fairy protagnist you spend years getting to know.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="spookpic" src="imgs/spook.jpg" alt="The Spook's Apprentice, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="spook">
          <h3>The Spook's Apprentice</h3>
          <h4>Joseph Delaney</h4>
          <p>I found this series when I was little older but it pulled me in just the same. The writing is fast paced and rich and the characters are memorable.</p>
          <p>The drawings and some of the imagery can make you uneasy but in a fun way.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="fowlpic" src="imgs/fowl.jpg" alt="Artemis Fowl, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="fowl">
          <h3>Artemis Fowl</h3>
          <h4>Eoin Colfer</h4>
          <p>Another story full of fairies and monsters and magic. Speaking of memorable characters, Artemis Fowl is unique in that you have a main protagonist being the villain in the world he's in. Still, it doesn't keep you from rooting for him to reach his goals.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="warriorpic" src="imgs/warrior.jpg" alt="Warrior Cats, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="warrior">
          <h3>Warrior Cats</h3>
          <h4>Erin Hunter</h4>
          <p>One of the first longterm series I ever read, it defintely fueled my obsession with warriors and cats. </p>
          <p>For a child's book, there's a lot of scandal, violence and drama but Hunter knows how to balance it out and keep it from being scary.</p>
        </section>

      <h2 id="titlethree">Graphic Novels/Comics</h2>

        <img id="japanpic" src="imgs/japan.jpg" alt="Japan Ai, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="japan">
          <h3>Japan Ai</h3>
          <h4>Aimee Major Steinberger</h4>
          <p>A quirky travel journal full of cutesy but detailed drawings. I can read this book over and over for the visuals alone. You can find something new with each reread and it makes you want to go traveling too!</p>
        </section>

        <img id="spacepic" src="imgs/space.jpg" alt="Spaceboy, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="space">
          <h3>Space Boy</h3>
          <h4>Stephen McCranie</h4>
          <p>Despite it being free online, I bought the first volume as soon as I could. Space Boy has such a unique atmosphere around it, easily going from deeply melonchaly to being full of touching and sweet moments. The art is beautiful and deserves to be seen in all its printed glory.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="watchpic" src="imgs/watch.jpg" alt="Watchmen, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="watch">
          <h3>Watchmen</h3>
          <h4>Alan Moore</h4>
          <p>You've probably seen the movie, or heard about it or even read the comic before. It really was one of the first comics to depict Superheroes in a realistic way and deserves to recognized for that alone.</p>
          <p>If you're looking to be read about good heroes who are bad people, this is the book for you.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="monsterpic" src="imgs/monstress.jpg" alt="Monstress, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="monstress">
          <h3>Monstress</h3>
          <h4>Marjorie Liu</h4>
          <p>The art in the series is beautiful and flows easily through the pages. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out what exactly is going on, but the art alone carries the comic along.</p>
        </section>

      <h2 id="titlefour">Short Stories</h2>

        <img id="connorpic" src="imgs/o'connor.jpg" alt="Flannery O'Connor The Complete Stories, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="connor">
          <h3>The Complete Stories</h3>
          <h4>Flannery O'Connor</h4>
          <p>O'Connor is one of the masters of making the mundane scary. Reading through her stories full of despicable but sympathetic people often leaves you feeling conflicted in a way that only the best kind of writing can.</p>
        </section>

        <img id="lotterypic" src="imgs/lottery.jpg" alt="The Lottery and Other Stories, photo from amazon.com"/>
        <section id="lottery">
          <h3>The Lottery and Other Stories</h3>
          <h4>Shirley Jackson</h4>
          <p>Jackson is another great Southern Gothic writer like O'Connor. She knows just how to make her readers uneasy and paranoid. She can make you question whether or not the fantastical things taking place in her stories could actually happen.</p>
